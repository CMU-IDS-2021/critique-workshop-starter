## Instructions

### Run Locally

Check out the Streamlit [getting started](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) guide and setup your Python environment.

To run the application locally, install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or another preferred method to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`). Then run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.

### Deploy to Streamlit Sharing

Before you can view your application online, you need to have it set up with Streamlit Sharing. To do this, create an issue that asks the TAs to deploy your repo. To create the issue, you can follow [this link](../../issues/new?body=Dear+TAs%2C+please+add+our+repo+to+Streamlit+sharing+and+then+respond+to+this+issue+with+the+URL+to+the+deployed+application.&title=Setup+Streamlit+sharing&assignees=kunalkhadilkar,hypotext) They will respond with a URL for your application. Once the repo is set up, please update the URL as the top of this readme and add the URL as the website for this GitHub repository.

### Deliverables

- [ ] An interactive persuasive narrative (incorporating 2-3 visualizations with your changes or annotations) using Streamlit.
